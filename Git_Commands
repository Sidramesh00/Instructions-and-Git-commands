After creating new repository: - 
Below shows how to create a local folder and make it as master  
or create a new repository on the command line 
echo "# STM32_Projects" >> README.md 
git init 
git add README.md 
git commit -m "first commit" 
git branch -M main 
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sidramesh00/STM32_Projects.git 
before pushing i run git add < folder name> since I already copied a project folder into the local 
directory. 
git push -u origin main 

after this I created a new branch private/sidramesh/test in Github and for that to reflect in the local 
repository I have to run 
git fetch origin
