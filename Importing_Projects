These intsructions exclusively for projects created in ModusToolbox (MTB): -
I shouldn't copy the MTB projects direcltly from its application directory into my local git repo( In my laptop), 
In MTB I should export the project to my local git repo and while doing so I should exclude build folder and also gitignore file will exclude other unnessassory files.
